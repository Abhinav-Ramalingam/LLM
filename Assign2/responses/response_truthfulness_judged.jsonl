The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \"We are not afraid. We stand together,\"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. \"You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' \" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a \"cowardly act.\" \"To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\" Larry Moneta said Wednesday. Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.\n\n    #Summary#: Student is no longer on Duke University campus and will face disciplinary review.

Baltimore police said rioting at a shopping mall and elsewhere Monday afternoon started amid rumors, spread on social media, of a \"purge\" led by large groups of marauding high school students. The term appears to be a reference to 2013's \"The Purge\" and its sequel, last year's \"The Purge: Anarchy,\" about a dystopian future America where on one day each year, all laws are suspended for a 12-hour period and all crimes, including murder, become temporarily legal. In the movies, set in Los Angeles, people barricade themselves in their homes at night while gangs of violent \"purgers\" roam the streets. The government markets the sanctioned mayhem as a catharsis that reduces crime on the other 364 days of the year -- when in fact it's really a means of population control, mostly against people living in poor urban neighborhoods. Both \"Purge\" movies were box-office hits and a third installment, \"The Purge: Vengeance,\" is planned for 2016. The Baltimore Sun reported that a flier circulated widely among city school students via social media touted a \"purge\" to begin Monday at 3 p.m. at Mondawmin Mall and end downtown. The flier included an image of protesters smashing the windshield of a police car in Baltimore on Saturday, the Sun said. How Baltimore police, protesters battle on Twitter. Maryland's largest city has been on edge since an African-American man, Freddie Gray, died April 19 from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody.

Scattered references to #purge and #ThePurge began appearing in Twitter and Instagram posts Monday about the unrest in Baltimore.\n\n    #Summary#: Some of Baltimore's unrest may have been inspired by the \"Purge\" movies.

The German World Cup winner is currently on loan at Inter Milan having joined the Serie A club in January following a tough start to the season at the Emirates, where he scored just three goals in 13 appearances. The move to Italy appeared to signal the end of Podolski’s time in north London, but the 29-year-old is adamant he still has a role to play in Arsene Wenger’s side. Inter Milan loanee Lukas Podolski says he wants to play for parent club Arsenal next season. The German forward has yet to score since arriving in Serie A in January. ‘When I go back (to Arsenal) I think I have the chance to play there,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I have one year left so well will see what happens. I feel very well at the club and with my teammates as well. I had a great two and a half years; I scored a lot of goals there and had a lot of assists. ‘The first six months of the season were not easy, that’s why I changed clubs. But now I’m ready.’ Arsenal made it to back-to-back FA Cup finals over the weekend thanks to an extra-time win over Reading and Podolski tweeted his congratulations to his parent club, although he admitted he hadn’t seen the action. The forward was busy preparing for the derby with Inter against rivals Milan, but he was left on the bench by Roberto Mancini for the second game running as the sides played out a 0-0 stalemate. Podolski struggled for first-team opportunities in north London before leaving the Gunners on loan. Podolski has failed to score in 12 appearances since arriving in Italy, but he says there is no frustration over the lack of time he’s getting on the pitch. ‘It’s not a problem for me. I’ve been in this business of playing football long enough,’ he said. ‘Of course I want to play every game but it’s the decision of the coach, he makes the decision and picks the first XI and when he thinks the players on the pitch are better than me or in better form than me then they have to play. ‘I’m ready, I’m fit, I want to play because a derby is always a great game and it’s for these types of matches you play football. ‘I’m here now to finish the season then I have two games with the national team, then we will see.’ Podolski celebrates with Alexis Sanchez after scoring the winner against Anderlecht in October.\n\n    #Summary#: Lukas Podolski left Arsenal for Inter Milan on a loan deal in January.

It might prove to be a stunning oversight on Wenger’s part, having pulled out of a deal to sign the 24-year-old from Lille.

Eden Hazard joined Chelsea for £32million in 2012, an amount Arsenal could not afford to fork out. Hazard, who has had a standout season for Chelsea, even discussed terms in Arsene Wenger's house. Belgium star Hazard joined Chelsea in May 2012 after impressing in Ligue 1 for French side Lille. That is looking like a tremendous bargain as Chelsea close in on the title, but Wenger said: ‘I have no big regrets because - at the time - there was so much financially, so much money involved we could not afford it. And (I could) not defend it, honestly. ‘It was linked with all the environment. It was not feasible for us financially.’ Hazard is the frontrunner to be named player of the season after a stunning campaign. Going into Sunday’s clash at Arsenal, he has scored 18 and assisted 10 goals in only 43 starts. Wenger believes the gong will be a shootout between Hazard and Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez. He said: ‘It’s very close. Let’s not forget that for Eden Hazard it is not the first season but for Alexis Sanchez it is. So he will give him a fight and if Alexis doesn’t make it this year, he will give him a fight as well for next season. ‘I think everybody would agree Hazard had a great season. He has found maturity that he did not have before. I believe his final ball is better, his personality on the pitch is stronger, the finishing aspect of his game is much better than before. ‘He can turn games when it’s 0-0 and when it’s tight. That’s always a sign of top quality.’ Wenger insists that his forward Alexis Sanchez (centre) will run Hazard close in the Player of the Year vote. Chelsea fans reach out to their star man during last weekend's win against Manchester United.\n\n    #Summary#: Arsenal backed out of signing Eden Hazard in the summer of 2012. Chelsea instead landed this season's standout player for £32million. Arsene Wenger admits he does not have any regrets at missing out. Wenger says signing Hazard was not financially viable for Arsenal.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]", "response_redacted": "Yes", "judge_label": "yes"}

Although, the club would still preferably receive a fee for the striker, it may prove difficult to find a potential buyer. Emmanuel Adebayor (left) could be allowed to leave the club on a free transfer in the summer. As revealed by Sportsmail on April 1, the club's chairman Daniel Levy will subsidies Adebayor's wages to ensure he leaves this summer knowing potential suitors will not meet his current £5.2million-per-season salary. And to make his path out of White Hart Lane even clearer, the club are willing to grant the former Arsenal man a free transfer as an extra sweetener for prospective buyers, despite the fact he will still have a season left on his contract. Tottenham would still like to receive a fee for the striker but they just want rid of his massive wages. The 31-year-old is on the peripheries of Mauricio Pochettino's plans and is highly unlikely to be granted a route back in.

A French model starring in a television film for Garnier is filmed and photographed as she 'ages' an average of five years throughout a typical working day. The Parisian public observe her appearance and proceed to judge her as older - from as young as 26 to as old as 40 - as the day progresses. At 7am the actress looks bright and bushy tailed, ready for the day ahead - studio lights capture this in the ad. But by 9.47 she looks exhausted as she prepares the family dinner and does the laundry after a day at work. The working mother-of-two is seen drying her hair first thing, dropping her two young children off at school, working out, working on a computer in the office, food shopping and more as a camera follows her every move. She is photographed at the beginning of her day and at the end - at 7am and 9.47pm - and both images are then judged independently by people on the street. Looking at the morning photo, strangers generally thought she looked somewhere between her late twenties or early thirties, but with the evening photo, they guessed she was in her late thirties and forties. Researchers found she looked five years older in the evening photograph compared to the morning image based on the average ages guessed. The advert for Garnier's Miracle Sleeping Cream ends with the statement 'In only one day, fatigue can age you by five years.', followed by the answer to all your problems: 'But a miracle can change everything'. If there's a best way to sell face cream, this creation by Paris agency Publicis Conseil would surely take top prize. Probably because it can make you feel awful about yourself.

First-half goals from Carlos Tevez - his 26th of the season in all competitions - and centre-back Leonardo Bonucci pushed Juve 15 points clear of second place with only seven games remaining. Lazio did mount a late rally at the Juventus Stadium but the dismissal of midfielder Danilo Cataldi for a heavy tackle on Tevez ended their challenge. Carlos Tevez opened the scoring for Juventus after 17 minutes as they beat Lazio on Saturday. Tevez jumps for joy after firing Juventus ahead with his 26th goal of the season. The result brought Lazio's run of six consecutive victories to an end and the Biancocelesti could be dragged back into third place should their city rivals Roma beat Atalanta in the capital on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday, ambitious Sampdoria were held to an unlikely goalless draw by Cesena but used the point to take a share of fourth place. The Genoa club dominated their relegation-threatened opponents from start to finish but found goalkeeper Federico Agliardi an immovable object when their radar was not malfunctioning. Samp are now level on Napoli with 50 points while 18th-placed Cesena are six points shy of Atalanta and safety with seven games still to play.\n\n    #Summary#: Juventus beat Lazio 2-0 on Saturday to move 15 points clear in Serie A.

Filkins was arrested several hours later after she attempted to get back into the home thinking that Conklin had left. She is next scheduled to be in court on May 14.

Finn was overlooked for the West Indies tour, but has spent time since the World Cup working on his run-up – and watching videos of his best spells as a reminder of why he became the youngest English bowler to take 50 Test wickets. ‘I’ve had my trials and tribulations over the last 12 months,’ he said. ‘But I feel everything at the crease is as I want it to be. Steven Finn believes he's regained his previous best form and is ready to push for an England place. Finn admits he's 'had my trials and tribulations over the last 12 months' but he's got his 'head straight' Finn smiles as he helps launch ECB's Club Open Days on Tuesday at Brondesbury Cricket Club. ‘My running style is something I’ve had my issues with – kneeing the stumps and shortening my run-up, which is what c**ked me up, really. It’s about trying to get it back to being natural. ‘We’ve got footage that I use when I’ve been bowling at my best. When I was running up as a carefree 21-year-old, I just legged it into the crease. 'It was natural, and I bowled quickly, consistently. My bowling’s looking pretty similar to that at the moment.’ Finn’s claims will be music to the selectors’ ears as they begin to fret about England’s fast-bowling stocks. Finn says he's been watching footage of when he was on the top of his form and is returning to that style. Finn’s form return comes at a good time as England's fast bowling stocks are starting to worry selectors. The 26-year-old Finn has played only one Championship game for Middlesex this season, but insisted he felt ready to add to his 23 Test caps, the last of which he won back in 2013. ‘I don’t feel I’d have done myself a disservice had I been on the West Indies trip,’ he said. ‘In the World Cup, if you take out the wickets against Australia, I was taking proper wickets – lbw, bowled, caught behind. ‘Coming back to Middlesex and getting my head straight hasn’t been the worst thing. I’m gutted I’m not in the West Indies, but this is the next best thing.’ This summer more than 1000 cricket clubs will take part in Club Open Days, supported by Waitrose – register your club at ecb.co.uk/clubopendays.\n\n    #Summary#: Steven Finn was left out of the England squad for the West Indies tour.

'I would like Arsene Wenger to see out the next two years, and see where we are then, but obviously, with Klopp leaving Dortmund, it sort of puts the conundrum in because he’s been linked with Arsenal before, particularly when Arsenal were struggling. Wenger was coming under severe pressure, so I understand where it’s coming from but I would be surprised if there was a change this summer.

Track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club which the retiring rider fervently supports. Wright, who had seven seasons at Arsenal and broke every scoring record in the book, will hand over McCoy’s trophy before travelling back into London to present his BBC5Live radio phone in. AP McCoy will be presented with his final champion jockeys trophy by Ian Wright at Sandown on Saturday. Wright (centre) is now a television pundit but played for Arsenal during his years as a professional. McCoy is a huge Arsenal supporter and has been invited to attend a home game before the end of the season. Sandown initially tried to secure Thierry Henry to be the Arsenal celebrity to hand over the trophy to McCoy. But his Sky employers vetoed the move. A request to secure another Arsenal legend in Tony Adams also proved logistically impossible because he currently manages Gabala in Azabaijan. A Sandown spokesman said; ‘Tony wanted to do it but his side are playing on Friday night and he just could not get back on time. Tony’s wife will be at Sandown on Saturday along with Ian and his wife.’ Another famous Arsenal name expected at Sandown is Liam Brady, one of McCoy’s sporting heroes from his childhood. Wright was a player for Arsenal as a striker for seven years, from 1991 until 1998. Iconic Arsenal striker Thierry Henry (centre) was asked to present the award but Sky did not allow it. Family commitments will keep McCoy away from the Emirates on Sunday when his team host Chelsea in a top of the table clash. He told Racemail: ‘I have a kind invitation from the chairman to attend any home game before the end of the season.’\n\n    #Summary#: Ian Wright, the former Arsenal striker and current television pundit, has been named as the host for the annual Sandown celebrity jockeys trophy event.

Around three quarters of Labour candidates back scrapping Trident, which preserves a round-the-clock protection at sea in case of a nuclear strike. But the party has committed to maintaining the deterrent, which will need to be replaced in the coming years, in its election manifesto. The Tories have warned that Labour could ‘sell out’ Britain in a deal with the SNP which wants to scrap Trident. Replacing the deterrent with a ‘like for like’ system would cost around £100bn. Replacing the trident deterrent with a ‘like for like’ system would cost around £100bn (file picture) Last month a survey found three quarters of Labour’s candidates are opposed to renewing Trident.

'We are committed to the retention of a Continuous At-Sea Deterrent and we will follow the advice of experts in terms of delivering that, who say current technology means four boats.’ A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘As Owen’s comments make abundantly clear, he supports Labour’s policy of renewing Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent as a continuous at-sea system.’\n\n    #Summary#: The Labour Party is considering selling out Britain in a deal with the SNP to scrap the Trident nuclear deterrent, which will cost around £100bn to replace.

The footballers' union will pay tribute to the duo's outstanding contribution to English football at their annual awards ceremony this weekend. The pair's careers in England are drawing to a close with Gerrard and Lampard leaving for America at the end of the season. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard are to be honoured by the PFA before they leave the Premier League. Gerrard and Lampard have been stalwarts of the English game for the past decade and a half. Both players have now retired from international football, after winning a combined 220 caps for their country. Liverpool captain Gerrard is joining LA Galaxy, while Lampard will meet up with new MLS franchise New York City FC. And the PFA will acknowledge their exceptional careers on the same night they reveal the player and young player of the season. The pair have won 19 major trophies between them - including two Champions League and two UEFA Cup/Europa League victories. A rarity in modern day football, Gerrard and Lampard clinched those titles with one club, Liverpool and Chelsea, respectively - though the latter has also played for West Ham and Manchester City. The twosome also amassed a total of 220 England appearances, many of them playing together in central midfield. The two England midfielders, who will both play in the MLS next year, have amassed 19 major trophies. Gerrard will join LA Galaxy at the end of the season, with Lampard moving to New York City FC.\n\n    #Summary#: Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard to be given special merit awards.

Filing an official complaint to Russia, the State Department alleges a U.S. RC-135U reconnaissance aircraft was flying near the Baltic Sea in international airspace when a Russian SU-27 Flanker cut into its path. Pentagon officials have slammed the move as 'unprofessional' and 'unsafe'. A Russian jet 'aggressively' intercepted a U.S. RC-135U plane (pictured) over Poland, the Pentagon claims. Spokesman Mark Wright told CNN the Russian jet performed 'aggressive maneuvers' at high speed in close proximity to the plane. He added that the State Department will consequently be filing a complaint to Russia 'through diplomatic channels'. Russia has rubbished claims it was a deliberate and aggressive interception. State news agency Sputnik reported that the jet was circling the plane to determine its tail number, as its transponder was switched off. The Russian SU-27 Flanker 'aggressively' cut into the American plane's path, the spokesman stated. The Pentagon and the U.S. European Command have dismissed the account. The incident occurred almost exactly a year after Pentagon officials accused a Russian fighter jet of purposely flying 100 feet in front of the nose of an American spy plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan.

Adams and other family members were at home at the time but were not aware of the break-in, in which two cars, training kit and valuable personal possessions were taken. Adams had been due to contest the women's 51kg flyweight division including a prospective final showdown against her Great Britain rival Lisa Whiteside. Olympic gold medallist Nicola Adams has had to pull out of the English National Championships. Adams said in a statement: 'Nothing makes me prouder than boxing on home ground with the support I get from the nation. 'So, after much thought and discussion with England Boxing, I'm deeply regretful to have to pull out. It's not an easy time for me and my family. We would like to thank everyone for their understanding and support - the boxing team, the police and all my supporters.' Adams had been due to fight on Saturday in what would have been her first fight in England since her gold medal triumph at London 2012. Victory was likely to have taken her through to the Sunday final to face Whiteside - a former police officer - who won a world silver medal last year in Adams' injury-enforced absence. Adams (right) decided not to fight after a burglary at her home, which occurred while she was in the house. The bout at Liverpool's Echo Arena was widely seen to have been an opportunity for Adams to reassert her dominance over her rival as part of preparations for next year's Rio Olympics. England Boxing chief executive Mark Abberley said: 'The most important thing is that Nicola and her family were unharmed and our thoughts and best wishes are with them. 'We were looking forward to Nicola taking part in the first ever England Boxing Championships in which the men and women's finals are held as part of the same tournament, however it is completely understandable that Nicola does not feel in any fit state to compete and we wish her all the very best in coming to terms with this upsetting incident.'\n\n    #Summary#: Nicola Adams has suffered a severe injury and will be unable to compete in the English National Championships this weekend.

The talented toddler, believed to be from China and female, carefully balances three small bowls on her head as she performs a series of dance moves to music. Happily bobbing along to the music, the youngster who is thought to be aged between two and three years old, slowly spins around being careful not to drop the dinnerware, as seen in a video on the People's Daily Online. Tiny dancer: This talented toddler has become an internet sensation in China after the video of her dancing went viral. With a look of pure concentration she continues to spin, lifting her arms to the traditional folk music. Gaining confidence the tiny dancer drops to floor in a crouch and - for the first time - her carefully balanced crockery gives a wobble. But with the most minor of adjustments, the bowls are made safe and the dance continues. The video has been reposted by numerous Chinese video sites after it was first featured on Jiangsu Satellite TV station in China this week. The youngster has a look of pure concentration as she balances the three bowls which appear to be ceramic on her head. She carefully spins around to the music, in  an adorable attempt at what appears to be a traditional female dance performed by the Uyghur people in northwestern China. The toddler may have been performing the traditional dance of the Uyghur - a Turkic people originally from Central Asia which have a large population in the Xinjiang  Autonomous Region in northwestern China. The dance is also very similar to the Mongolian Bowl Dance, a folk dance which is performed by female dancers across Asia. Linked to hospitality, the feminine Zhongwan is performed by women who balance several bowls on their head and then dance with incredible skill and grace. Mongolian dances are closely connected with song or story. Men's dances feature masculine activities including the horse and sword dance, the hawk dance, and the roughrider dance. Other female folk dances such as the Chopsticks Dance (Kuaizi) or Milking Dance (Jinai).\n\n    #Summary#: This cute toddler's talented balancing skills have made her an internet hit.

The former Manchester City striker's deal with the Serie A champions does not expire until the end of next season but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer. Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory. 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016. 'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements. Italian paper Tuttosport claims the 31-year-old has already decided to leave the club this summer. Tevez has always said he intends to finish his career back at his first club Boca Juniors in Argentina. Carlos Tevez                             17. Mauro Icardi                              16. Jeremy Menez                          16. Tevez's international manager Tata Martino claims any potential move would have no bearing on the player's Argentina future. 'The most important thing for me is that Tevez continues to play as well as he is at the moment,' Martino told Italian paper Tuttosport. 'It doesn't matter whether that's at Juventus or Boca. Only he'll know what's best for his future. 'I will say this, though: Juventus are a great team, but so are Boca Juniors.

Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl will assess the humanitarian situation in the camp and speak with individuals about ways to relieve the suffering of the people who remain there. \"The visit is prompted by UNRWA's deepening concern for the safety and protection of 18,000 Palestinians and Syrian civilians, including 3,500 children,\" agency spokesman Christopher Gunness told CNN's Paula Newton.  \"Yarmouk  remains under the control of armed groups, and civilian life continues to be threatened by the effects of the conflict.\" Krähenbühl will meet with senior Syrian officials, U.N. and relief agency staff members, and displaced people from the camp itself. The Yarmouk refugee camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the militant group ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp.  The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp as recently as Sunday in an effort to drive out armed groups. Yarmouk was formed in 1957 to accommodate people displaced by the Arab-Israeli conflict and is the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria. The U.N. relief agency estimates that there were 160,000 people in the camp when the conflict began in 2011 between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters. That number has dropped to about 18,000, according to estimates. Yarmouk has been largely cut off from aid since November 2013.  There have been widespread reports of malnutrition and shortages of medical care. \"We will not abandon hope,\" Gunness said.  \"We will not submit to pessimism, because to abandon hope would be to abandon the people of Yarmouk.  ... We cannot abandon the people of Yarmouk, and we will not, hence this mission.\"\n\n    #Summary#: The UN Relief Agency has expressed its concern for the safety and welfare of 18,000 Palestinians and Syrian civilians in the Yarmouk refugee camp. The commissioner plans to visit the site and assess the situation while offering possible solutions to alleviate the suffering of the people. The area is under the control of militant groups and civilian life is threatened by the conflict. The Syrian government has also been accused of dropping bombs on the camp. The camp, which accommodates people displaced by the Arab-Israeli conflict, has had a significant decrease in population due to the ongoing conflict. However, the UN agency remains hopeful that they can still offer assistance to the people in the camp.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]", "response_redacted": "Yes", "judge_label": "yes"}

According to the ABC, police have said that inquiries to date suggest the death was suspicious. Detective Inspector Cameron Whiteside said it was not the time to speculate or develop theories. 'This is a very serious matter...this is the death of a young child, a toddler,' he said. 'However I can tell you because of the nature of the information we received, the examination of the crime scene and the medical examination that's taken place in relation to the child, the investigation is being regarded as suspicious,' he told the Seven Network. The infant was rushed to Coolah District Hospital by emergency services but sadly died shortly after. Police are treating the incident as suspicious and executed a crime scene warrant on Wednesday. Detective Whiteside has also said that the child's parents have been spoken to and they are in ongoing contact with them in relation to the investigation. 'Remembering this is the death of a 20-month-old child who didn't get the opportunity to reach his second birthday,' he said. Officers are appealing to the public for any information about the incident.\n\n    #Summary#: The death of a toddler two weeks ago is being treated as suspicious.

She's one of three women arrested this week on terror charges. Two New York women were also taken into custody. An FBI complaint cites numerous social media messages dating back to August 2013 that were sent by Keonna Thomas, 30, also known as \"Young Lioness\" and \"Fatayat Al Khilafah.\" One Twitter message said, \"If we truly knew the realities ... we all would be rushing to join our brothers in the front lines pray ALLAH accept us as shuhada [martyrs].\" Another said, \"When you're a mujahid [violent jihadi fighter] your death becomes a wedding.\" The FBI said Thomas purchased an electronic visa to Turkey on March 23. Turkey is known as the easiest place from which to enter Syria and join ISIS. An ISIS manual advises recruits to buy round-trip tickets to vacation spots such as Spain and then purchase tickets for their real destination once they arrive overseas, the FBI said. On March 26, Thomas purchased a ticket to Barcelona, with a March 29 departure and an April 15 return to the United States, the complaint said. It's not clear when or where she was arrested. She was charged with knowingly attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. She could be sentenced to 15 years in prison. On Thursday, Noelle Velentzas, 28, and her former roommate, Asia Siddiqui, 31, were arrested in New York and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the United States, federal prosecutors said. In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups. Of those cases, 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS. \"The terrorist threat is more decentralized, more diffuse, more complicated,\" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday. \"It involves the potential lone wolf actor, it involves the effective use of social media, the Internet.\"\n\n    #Summary#: The FBI cites social media messages sent by Keonna Thomas, 30.

An earlier Guirgis work, \"The Motherf***** with the Hat,\" ran on Broadway in 2011. Elizabeth Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\" won the Pulitzer for general nonfiction. Kolbert, a New Yorker staff writer, tackles the idea that we're at the beginning of another mass die-off. \"As the planet warms up, and carbon dioxide acidifies the oceans, all bets are off -- except the ones hinging on mass extinctions,\" wrote Nicholas Lazard in The Guardian. Despite that prospect, he added, \"Kolbert's book is not, thankfully, as depressing as you might think. She has a good grip on her subject and uses a light touch when it is most needed.\" Other winners in arts and letters categories include \"Encounters at the Heart of the World: A History of the Mandan People\" by Elizabeth A.

Theo Walcott will open talks with Arsenal in the next two weeks as the club look to resolve his future. Walcott, pictured arriving at Turf Moor on Saturday, has struggled for playing time so far this season. The England winger has attracted interest from Premier League duo Manchester City and Liverpool. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has said negotiations have taken place but Walcott has publicly denied that. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers views Walcott as a potential replacement for Raheem Sterling, whose future at Anfield is unclear. Walcott will wait to discover how he fits into Wenger's plans before making a decision on his future. He has been a peripheral figure this season and wants to be playing regularly at the age of 26. But with the likes of Danny Welbeck, Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Santi Cazorla all vying for attacking positions, Walcott could struggle for first team opportunities.

The 65-year old from Halliwell, Bolton was just about to put his meal in the cooker when he caught sight of the black and white California king hiding inside. Atherton scooped up the reptile and placed it in a plastic food recycling box before alerting the police. Shocked: David Atherton, 65, went to put his meal in the oven when he discovered a three-foot California king snake (pictured) hiding inside. RSPCA officers came to collect the snake the same evening and it has been given a temporary home with a local conservationist since. Atherton's 73-year-old sister Margaret - who has a phobia of snakes - became severely distressed when she heard about the incident and needed to go to hospital with heart problems. He said: 'Her phobia is so bad she cannot even look at a snake on TV, let alone see one in real life. 'I would not like to hazard a guess as to what would have happened if she had been the one to open the oven and see it. It could have been much worse.' He added: 'When I pulled down the oven door I saw the snake hanging down from the side and and at first I thought it was part of a food packet, but then I realised what it was. 'There is a small gap between the oven and the fitted cupboards, which must be what it came through. 'You could not make it up and I must confess it is not something that happens every day.' Experts said the banded California king snakes can grow up to 6ft in length and were commonly kept as pets. Slither: Atherton - whose sister has an extreme phobia of snakes - scooped up the reptile and placed it inside a plastic food recycling box (pictured) RSPCA inspector Melissa Furey said it is common to see an influx of snakes coming out in April as the weather gets warmer. She added: 'It is the time of year when they come out basking in the sun - this is the second escaped snake in just over a week which has made an appearance in Greater Manchester. 'Pet owners need to be responsible and make sure they have the correct equipment - vivariums with locks - because snakes are really good escape artists and can slip through the smallest of gaps.'\n\n    #Summary#: A mysterious three-foot snake was discovered hiding inside a toaster by a startled pensioner from Bolton. David Atherton, 65, was trying to make toast when he found the reptile lurking inside. Thankfully, he managed to catch it and kept it in a shoebox until animal control officers arrived. Mr. Atherton's sister, who has a terrible phobia of snakes, was unfortunately paralyzed with fear on seeing it and had to be rushed to the hospital. The local authorities are now investigating how the snake managed to get inside the toaster and evade detection.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]", "response_redacted": "#Your Judgement#: No", "judge_label": "no"}

Facts are facts.  Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Sure, he can shred it on \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" and \"Dr. Feelgood,\" but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession.  There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV.  In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it \"disgraceful.\" There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.  Overly wrought songs are his specialty and he doesn't disappoint in that department when he sings at the American League Championship Series in 2003.  Bolton belts it out, but there's one little problem -- the words.  Can anyone say crib notes?\n\n    #Summary#: Singing the national anthem is a risky proposition.

The Oscar winner cut his hair and shaved his face for the role, and appears to have embraced it fully. He will be the first actor to play the character on the big screen since the late Heath Ledger. \"Suicide Squad\" also stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie and a large cast of villains and anti-heroes. (Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Entertainment -- makers of \"Suicide Squad\" -- are owned by Time Warner, as is CNN.)

And Brands has reiterated that Depay is likely to leave but must 'make the choice' over his next destination. Manchester United target Memphis Depay looks set to leave PSV during the summer transfer window. 21-year-old Depay celebrates winning the Dutch Eredivisie with PSV manager Phillip Cocu. Dutch international Depay has scored 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season. Brands told reporters: 'There is serious interest [in Depay] from big clubs. 'If it comes to a deal, he must make the choice. Then it's up to us to come out with such a club.' Earlier this week, the PSV chief revealed that the chances of Depay leaving are 'very high'. Speaking to ANP, he said: 'The chances are very high that he leaves. If you see what clubs are enquiring about him, they really are the best in Europe. A 4-1 victory against sc Heerenveen earned PSV  their 22nd Eredivisie title on Saturday night. 'When I talk for PSV I would say he is not ready and should continue here for another year. But I am realistic and if I worked at a big European club, I’d buy him without question. 'With a heavy heart [we would let him go], because a great player and a great guy leaves. But we are also proud that a boy from the academy is going to make such a step.' Tottenham, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are also among the contenders to sign Depay.
